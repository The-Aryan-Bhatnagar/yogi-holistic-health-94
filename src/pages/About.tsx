                  <strong>Dr. Juhi Gautam</strong> has been practising yoga for over 25 years. She grew up in a Vedic culture 
                  in one of the holy places in India, where Ayurveda and yogic wisdom were part of her ancestral lineage. 
                  Her parents practiced a traditional lifestyle of yoga, pranayama, meditation, vegetarianism, prayers, 
                  chanting, satsang, and scripture study.

                  Juhi graduated as a doctor in 1997 from Bangalore, India, and moved to the UK in 1998 to further her 
                  academic qualifications. She became a member of the <strong>Royal College of Physicians (RCP)</strong> in 2002 
                  and is also a member of the <strong>Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP)</strong> in London.

              Her observation of Western medicine was that it was largely driven by the pharmaceutical industry and 
              lacked a holistic touch. While working as a specialist registrar at leading hospitals such as Chelsea 
              Westminster and Charing Cross, she transitioned into general practice to fulfill her dream of providing 
              holistic care in the community.

              By combining <strong>traditional yoga science</strong> with <strong>conventional medicine</strong>, she now 
              helps patients heal in a complete way. Dr. Gautam believes that disease develops due to imbalance â€” a 
              disharmony of <strong>mind, body, and spirit</strong>. Integrating treatment modalities that address all 
              three vital components can restore homeostasis.

              Today, there is a paradigm shift around the concepts of health, illness, and treatment options. In the recent past, 
              efficacy and therapeutic effects of yoga have been reported in various medical journals using latest technology, 
              suggesting that yoga has scientific basis.

              <strong>What causes diseases? What is the role of oxygen?</strong> Disease arises when there is an imbalance 
              in the body due to negative thoughts and energy. Oxygen is vital for life and life is about the breaths. 
              A person who maintains the synchronization of breathing leads a healthy and disease free life.

              Scientists have concluded that the chemical basis of energy production in the body is a chemical called 
              ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). If the production of this ATP is disrupted, the result is lowered vitality, 
              disease and premature ageing. Oxygen is considered critical for the production of this ATP and pranayam 
              allows us to tap into this vital component.

              Meditation is not recommended in depression with suicidal ideations and psychosis. In such cases, help must

              Please consult your chantinyoga practitioner before starting yoga and meditation. Yoga is not an immediate or quick
